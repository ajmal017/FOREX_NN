    "I have selected 3 indicators from the long list of indicators that are available and used by traders to see if they are effective features in a LSTM model. The reason for selecting them is that I personally trade using these indicators but manually. Using these indicators, can the closing price of the next 1 hour bar be predicted, and how well?\n",

    "### Candlestick charts\n",
    "\n",

    "![candles](images/candles2.png) \n",
    " \n",
    "- These bars are then visualized by plotting them with the price on the y axis. These candles are able to tell traders what the trading activity in that one hour time frame has been like. For example a bar with a small range between the open and close price but large range between the open or close and high or low price can be assessed as a period where there has been a lot of buying and selling activity, with price moving much higher and lower levels compared to the opening price but by the end of the one hour period closing not far from the opening price.\n",

    "\n",
    " - Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity, using a formulaic method propounded by John Bollinger in the 1980s. Financial traders employ these charts as a methodical tool to inform trading decisions, control automated trading systems, or as a component of technical analysis. Bollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope maximum and minimum of moving averages, and volatility (expressed by the width of the envelope) in one two-dimensional chart. \n",

    "### Exponential Moving Averages\n",
    "\n",
    " - An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA), which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period. \n",
    " Below is an exmaple of 4 EMAs - 8, 21, 50 & 200. These are 4 of the most commonly used by traders.\n",

    "### Stochastic Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "- In technical analysis of securities trading, the stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that uses support and resistance levels. George Lane developed this indicator in the late 1950s.The term stochastic refers to the point of a current price in relation to its price range over a period of time. This method attempts to predict price turning points by comparing the closing price of a security to its price range. \n",
